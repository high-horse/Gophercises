        "One of his friends once recommended going to New York to make friends at this mysterious thing called \"GothamGo\". It is supposed to be a big event with free swag and if there is one thing gophers love it is free trinkets. Unfortunately, the gopher once heard a campfire story about some bad fellas named the Sticky Bandits who also live in New York. In the stories these guys would rob toy stores and terrorize young boys, and it sounded pretty scary.",
        "On the other hand, he has always heard great things about Denver. Great ski slopes, a bad hockey team with cheap tickets, and he even heard they have a conference exclusively for gophers like himself. Maybe Denver would be a safer place to visit."
